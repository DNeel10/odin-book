## Odin-Book
Odin-book is a social media app that allows users to connect to one another, post thoughts, and comment as they feel appropriate.
It was built as part of the Ruby on Rails Full Stack Web development curriculum from The Odin Project.

## Technologies Used
Within this project, I used Ruby on Rails, Rspec, Turbo/Stimulus for Rails, OmniAuth2, and Bootstrap.
